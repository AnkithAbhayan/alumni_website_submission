# <a name="priority"></a> What we prioritized and what we didn't
## User-Interface/Front-end
- We have a built a fully static website and we've tried to satisfy as much of the user-requirements as possible.
- We directed our attention to the user-interface and the visual components of the website trying to make it as user-friendly, straightforward and interactive as possible.
- We did not spend time thinking about how the website would look when accessed via a mobile phone or a tablet, we've built it in such a way that it looks good on a screen which has an aspect ratio of `16:9`.

## Backend
- We did not spend much time on the backend of the website since we thought it would take a lot of time.
- We did not make use of Database management systems, APIs nor anything in between.    

### We've faced a few setbacks.
- Our lack of pre-requisite knowledge about web development, we've picked up everything as we went.
- The time on our hands, this wasn't helped by the sheer amount of assignments, records and activities we're given during vacations. But we did enjoy the journey and we did learn a lot on the way.

# Our philosophy
There are a few ideals that we've withheld throughout.  
Lines extracted from the [zen of python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) by [`Tim Peters`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)): 
> Beautiful is better than ugly.  
> Simple is better than complex.  
> Complex is better than complicated.  

# Features  
### Font
- We used the `Epilogue` font across all webpages.
- It is a free and open-source font.

### It's fast!
- We've ensured that the website is:
  - light-weight 
  - astonishingly fast 
  - minimalistic and easy to navigate

### Colours
- There's no specific name for the pattern of colours we've used, but its not a solid background. 
- Instead, its a linear gradient of lime and cyan making the background a treat to the eyes.

# Conclusion
- We built the entire website spanning across multiple webpages from the ground-up without the use of external tools other than those mentioned [here](#technologiestools-used).
- No use of templates, external software that lets you drag and drop widgets into the screen to create webpages, none.
